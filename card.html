                <h1>Deer</h1>
                <img src = "placeheader.png" alt = "Deer Picture">
                <div class="Information">
                    <p class="IntreastingFact">Deer have specialized stomachs with four compartments that help them digest tough, fibrous plants efficiently.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Taxonomic Family</strong>: Cervidae</li>
                        <li><strong>Average Lifespan in the Wild</strong>: 2-4 years</li>
                        <li><strong>Diet</strong>: Herbivorous (grass, leaves, twigs, fruits, bark)</li>
                        <li><strong>Habitat</strong>: Forests, grasslands, wetlands, tundra</li>
                        <li><strong>Size Range</strong>: 2-7 feet tall at the shoulder, depending on species</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="info3">Known for their keen senses, deer are quick to detect danger. Their slender bodies and long legs help them move swiftly, while their antlers, grown and shed each year, are used in mating displays and competition. Depending on the species, deer may live alone or in groups.</p>

                <h1>Tiger</h1>
                <img src = "tiger.jpeg" alt = "tiger Picture" >
                <div class="Information">
                    <p class="IntreastingFact">Tigers are the only big cats that enjoy swimming—so basically, they’re the Michael Phelps of the jungle.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Taxonomic Family</strong>: Felidae</li>
                        <li><strong>Average Lifespan in the Wild</strong>: 10-15 years</li>
                        <li><strong>Diet</strong>: Carnivorous (deer, wild boar, buffalo, smaller mammals)</li>
                        <li><strong>Habitat</strong>: Forests, grasslands, mangroves</li>
                        <li><strong>Size Range</strong>: 3-4 feet tall at the shoulder, 7-12 feet long including the tail</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="info3">Tigers are solitary and territorial big cats, known for their powerful build and distinctive orange coat with black stripes. They rely on stealth and strength to ambush prey, using their sharp claws and strong jaws. Excellent swimmers, they often inhabit areas near water sources.</p>

                <h1>Kangaroo</h1>
                <img src = "Kangaroo.jpeg" alt = "Kangaroo Picture" >
                <div class="Information">
                    <p class="IntreastingFact">Kangaroos can’t walk backward, so they’re basically programmed to only move forward—just like your motivational speaker wants you to do!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Taxonomic Family</strong>: Macropodidae</li>
                        <li><strong>Average Lifespan in the Wild</strong>: 6-8 years</li>
                        <li><strong>Diet</strong>: Herbivorous (grasses, leaves, flowers, fruits)</li>
                        <li><strong>Habitat</strong>: Grasslands, woodlands, deserts</li>
                        <li><strong>Size Range</strong>: 3-8 feet tall, depending on species</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="info3">Kangaroos are famous for their powerful hind legs, which allow them to hop great distances at high speeds. They use their muscular tails for balance, and females carry their young (joeys) in a pouch until they’re ready to explore the world.</p>
